# firefox-kde
Wrapper to pair Firefox profiles with KDE sessions.
I got the idea from here: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=137941 and made it work with recent KDE and Firefox.

Working for me on KDE 4.14 and Firefox 36.0.1.

Just use the shelal script and .desktop file (you might have to adjust the script path there) as you default browser.
